mandel-julia is a program to generate Mandelbrot and Julia sets. It is
a purely command line program at the moment, but I may build a front
end for it eventually.

It is written in C++ for speed.

At them moment it is somewhat broken as I got halfway through a major
redesign before deciding to start using github. Hopefully progress
will be made rapidly and working snapshots will become available.
